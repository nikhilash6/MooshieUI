# Configures branch protection on Mooshieblob1/MooshieUI:main via the GitHub API.
#
# Prerequisites:
#   - gh CLI installed and authenticated: gh auth login
#   - The glassworm-scan workflow must have completed at least one successful run
#     so GitHub has registered "GlassWorm Infection Audit" as a known check name.
#     If branch protection is applied before the first run, all PRs will be permanently
#     blocked with "Required status check has never run."
#
# Run once from a developer workstation after cloning:
#   bash scripts/setup-branch-protection.sh
